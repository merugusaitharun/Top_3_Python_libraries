# Numpy
  
  NumPy is a Python library that makes working with arrays and   performing mathematical operations on them easy and efficient.

  

 ### Introduction
 Welcome to the NumPy Course! This course will teach you how to use NumPy for numerical computing in Python. You'll learn about array creation, manipulation, and a variety of mathematical operations.
 
### Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Python installed on your computer

### Course Outline

- Introduction to NumPy
- Creating and Manipulating Arrays
- Array Indexing and Slicing
- Mathematical Operations with NumPy
- Practical Examples


### Examples

import numpy as np

#### Create a 1D array
one_d_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

#### Create a 2D array
two_d_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])


### Array Operations
 
#### Element-wise addition
result = np.add(one_d_array, 10)

#### Matrix multiplication
matrix1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

matrix2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

product = np.dot(matrix1, matrix2)



# pandas

Pandas is a powerful and easy-to-use library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It helps you work with data structures like tables, making it simple to clean, organize, and analyze large amounts of data. With pandas, you can read and write data from various formats like CSV, Excel, and databases, and perform complex operations with just a few lines of code. It's a must-have tool for anyone working with data in Python.

 ### Introduction

 Pandas is a popular Python library used for working with data. It makes it easy to clean, organize, and analyze data. With pandas, you can quickly load data from different sources, like spreadsheets or databases, and perform operations to explore and understand your data. It's especially useful for tasks like data cleaning, transformation, and analysis, making it a favorite tool for data scientists and analysts.

 ### Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Python installed on your computer

### Course Outline
- Introduction to Pandas
- Data Loading (using CSV, Excel, etc.)
- Creating DataFrames and Series
- Indexing and selecting data
- Combining data from different sources
- Handling missing data
- Data transformation
- Working with time series data
- Pivot tables



### Examples
- A Series is like a column in a table. It is a one-dimensional array holding data of any type.

import pandas as pd

#### Creating a Series
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

series = pd.Series(data)

print(series)


- A DataFrame is like a table with rows and columns.
import pandas as pd

#### Creating a DataFrame
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
    'Age': [24, 27, 22, 32],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df)



# Matplotlib


Matplotlib for Data Visualization

This course empowers you to create compelling data visualizations using Matplotlib, a powerful Python library.

### Introduction

Matplotlib is a powerful and widely used plotting library in Python. It enables you to create a variety of plots, charts, histograms, and other visualizations to explore and communicate your data effectively. Whether you're analyzing data, building interactive dashboards, or creating publication-quality figures, Matplotlib provides the tools to visualize your insights with clarity and precision.

### Course Content

* Introduction to Matplotlib and Plotting Fundamentals
* Creating Various Chart Types (Line, Scatter, Bar, etc.)
* Customizing Plots (Colors, Labels, Legends, Axes)
* Combining Multiple Plots using Subplots
* Working with Dates and Time Series Data (optional)
* Interaction and Animation (optional)
